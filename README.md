# Unity_ROS_Bridge
This project uses a websocket and JSON to provide the ability to communicate between rosbridge_suite and Unity C#.

## Getting Started
This project has two dependencies that must be installed before use. 
1. websocket-sharp
2. SimpleJSON

After installing these two dependencies, ensure that ROS is listening for inbounding websocket connections.
